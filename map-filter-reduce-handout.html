//~ * Map * ~

//TODO Together: Let's see a common approach we might have done in the past: our goal is to increase each element of an array by 1 [element + 1], then get an array back with those values

//TODO Together: Now, let's achieve the same result with the first part of our lesson: the MAP method~

//TODO Together: Let's get all these restaurant names out of this array of objects with .map()!

//TODO: Create your own array of (up to 3 and at least 2) restaurant objects building off of the basic list you created during the MapBox exercise (or build one anew!) ~5 mins
const restaurants = [
    {
        name:"Chama Ga√∫cha Brazilian Steakhouse",
        address:"18318 Sonterra Pl, San Antonio, TX 78258",
        ratingStars: 1
    },
    {
        name: "Pollos Asados Los Nortenos",
        address: "4642 Rigsby Ave, San Antonio, TX 78222",
        ratingStars: 1
    },
    {
        name: "Smokey Mo's BBQ",
        address: "7915 W Loop 1604 N Ste 101, San Antonio, TX 78254",
        ratingStars: 1
    }
];

let restaurantName = restaurants.map(function (place){
    return place.name;
})
console.log(restaurantName)
let restaurantMessage = restaurants.map(function (place){
    console.log(`${place.name} which is located at ${place.address} i would give a rating of ${place.ratingStars} stars!`);
})
console.log(restaurantMessage)
//TODO: Now, having created a personal array of restaurant objects for yourself, use .map() to get your favorite restaurant's names out of that collection, into another array, and out into the console! ~5 mins

//~ * Filter * ~

//TODO Together: Once again, let's take a look at the old way we might approach an issue: getting only one type of values out of an array (for example: even numbers only from an array of nums!)

//TODO Together: Now, let's refactor the above using the ES6 .filter() method with the same goal: even numbers only!

//TODO Together: Using my favoriteRestaurants list, let's filter out all of the non-buffet restaurants

// all restaurants in the zipcode
let zipcodeRestaurant  = restaurants.filter(function (place){
    return place.address.includes("78254");
})
console.log(zipcodeRestaurant);


//TODO: Each one of your restaurant arrays is unique, but, in that array, identify something to filter by - it could be as simple as "well, let me filter out all of the restaurants with names shorter than 8 characters" or get as complicated as you'd like!

//TODO: Once you've done the above, go ahead and write the necessary code to achieve what you wanted - remember to practice with .filter() and our ES6 verbiage!

//~ * Reduce * ~

//Reduce is an interesting animal in and of itself: it's a way to reduce a collection down to, typically, a single value of some kind:

//TODO Together: Let's sum up some numbers with the .reduce() method and a number array!


//TODO Together: That's pretty wild, eh! Wonder what else we could get up to with .reduce() - how about we make a function and use .reduce() inside of it? We'll write a function named countWords that takes a sentence in a single string. We need to split that sentence into an array and then write a .reduce() that would let us know how many times each word appeared in the string.


//TODO Together: Pretty good, but do we want to count the number of times the comma is involved? If only we had a method that would .filter() - wait! Let's refactor the above function to do just that!



//TODO: Let's make a new array of objects to use - make an array of objects [{},{},{}] consisting of a number of family members as objects with their name and ages as properties. Use .reduce() to sum up the age of those family members and see what it is! e.g. [{name: "Thurston Howell III", age: 50}, {name: "William Dean Howells", age: 83}] would be 133 by adding those two age properties together (50 + 83).
let family = [
    {
        name: "Tatiana",
        age: 16
    },
    {
        name: "Alejandro",
        age: 10
    },
    {
        name: "Daniel",
        age: 6
    }];

let combinedAge = family.reduce(function(total, person){
    person = person.filter(function(people){
        return people.name.includes("e");
    });
    console.log(filtered);
    return total + filtered.age;
}, 0)

console.log(combinedAge)
